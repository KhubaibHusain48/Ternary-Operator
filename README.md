# ❓ Ternary Operator Example

This Java program demonstrates the use of the **ternary operator** to find the greater of two numbers entered by the user.

## 📋 Features

* Accepts two integers as input.
* Uses the ternary operator (`condition ? trueValue : falseValue`) to find and print the greater number.
* Includes commented traditional `if-else` approach for comparison.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites

* Java installed (JDK 8 or higher)

### Steps

1. Save the code in a file named `TernaryOperator.java` inside a folder named `Expressions` (to match the package).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory above `Expressions`.
3. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   javac Expressions/TernaryOperator.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   java Expressions.TernaryOperator
   ```

## 💡 Sample Output

```
Enter the first number: 
15
Enter the second number: 
20
The greater number is: 20
```

## 🧠 Concepts Used

* Ternary operator (`? :`)
* User input handling
* Package structure
